# Design Systems

This a monorepo that contains the implementation for the Mercury and Unanimo design systems. It also contains packages that serves as tooling for creating icons that are compatible with these design systems.

## Packages

### Mercury

[Mercury Design System](/packages/mercury/README.md) is a robust and scalable solution designed to improve product development. It's implemented over [Chameleon](https://github.com/genexuslabs/chameleon-controls-library) a library of white-label, highly-customizable and reusable web components, which implements all components necessaries for the Mercury DS.

To see the documentation and examples of how to use Mercury, visit the [showcase](https://mercury-showcase.genexus.com).

### Unanimo

[Unanimo Design System](/packages/unanimo/README.md) is a solution oriented to mission-critical business applications and the back-office generated by GeneXus.
