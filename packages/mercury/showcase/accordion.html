              A filled accordion is a UI component used to organize content into
              collapsible sections, offering a background color that helps
              visually separate it from surrounding elements. It enhances
              webpage navigation by keeping content compact and makes the
              accordion stand out, encouraging users to easily access or hide
              detailed information with a simple click.

                      The File object in GeneXus is designed to handle
                      file-related operations within an application. It allows
                      developers to work with files stored locally or on a
                      server by providing methods to upload, download, open,
                      read, write, and manipulate files in various formats. This
                      object is particularly useful for managing documents,
                      images, or any other type of file interaction, making it
                      easier to handle file-based processes within business
                      applications.

                      The Domain object in GeneXus allows developers to define a
                      specific data type with associated validation rules,
                      formatting, and constraints, which can be reused across
                      various parts of an application. It helps ensure
                      consistency and standardization for commonly used data
                      types, such as emails, phone numbers, or currencies. By
                      creating Domains, developers can streamline application
                      maintenance and enforce uniform data validation throughout
                      the system.

                      The Procedure object in GeneXus is used to define a
                      sequence of actions or logic that can be executed within
                      an application. It allows developers to create reusable
                      routines to process data, perform calculations, update
                      databases, or call external services. Procedures can be
                      triggered by user actions or scheduled tasks, and they
                      offer flexibility for handling complex business logic
                      while improving the modularity and maintainability of the
                      application.

                      exporting documents in various formats like PDF, Word, or
                      HTML. It allows developers to create dynamic reports,
                      invoices, or other formal documents by merging static text
                      with data from the application. The Document object is
                      ideal for automating the creation of printable and
                      shareable files within business workflows.

                      The File object in GeneXus is designed to handle

                      developers to work with files stored locally or on a
                      server by providing methods to upload, download, open,
                      read, write, and manipulate files in various formats. This
                      object is particularly useful for managing documents,
                      images, or any other type of file interaction, making it

                      consistency and standardization for commonly used data
