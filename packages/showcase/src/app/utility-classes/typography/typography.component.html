  <p class="text-body-regular-l">
    Using HTML headings provides structure and clarity to your web content,
    enhancing both accessibility and SEO. The h1 tag should be used only once
    per page as the main title, representing the primary topic.
  </p>

  <blockquote class="blockquote-info">
    <b>Important:</b> Subsequent headings (h2, h3, etc.) should follow a
    cascading order: h2 under h1, h3 under h2, and so on. Skipping levels, like
    using h4 before h3, disrupts this flow and can confuse users and search
    engines. Proper heading use ensures clear, organized content, improving user
    experience.
