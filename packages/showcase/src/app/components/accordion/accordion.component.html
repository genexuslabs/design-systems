        The File object in GeneXus is designed to handle file-related operations
        within an application. It allows developers to work with files stored
        locally or on a server by providing methods to upload, download, open,
        read, write, and manipulate files in various formats. This object is
        particularly useful for managing documents, images, or any other type of
        file interaction, making it easier to handle file-based processes within
        business applications.
      </div>
      <div slot="domain" class="text-body-regular-m spacing-body">
        The Domain object in GeneXus allows developers to define a specific data
        type with associated validation rules, formatting, and constraints,
        which can be reused across various parts of an application. It helps
        ensure consistency and standardization for commonly used data types,
        such as emails, phone numbers, or currencies. By creating Domains,
        developers can streamline application maintenance and enforce uniform
        data validation throughout the system.
      </div>
      <div slot="procedure" class="text-body-regular-m spacing-body">
        The Procedure object in GeneXus is used to define a sequence of actions
        or logic that can be executed within an application. It allows
        developers to create reusable routines to process data, perform
        calculations, update databases, or call external services. Procedures
        can be triggered by user actions or scheduled tasks, and they offer
        flexibility for handling complex business logic while improving the
        modularity and maintainability of the application.
      </div>
      <div slot="document" class="text-body-regular-m spacing-body">
        The Document object in GeneXus is designed to handle text-based content,
        such as generating, manipulating, and exporting documents in various
        formats like PDF, Word, or HTML. It allows developers to create dynamic
        reports, invoices, or other formal documents by merging static text with
        data from the application. The Document object is ideal for automating
        the creation of printable and shareable files within business workflows.
