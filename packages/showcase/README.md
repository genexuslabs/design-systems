# Showcase

This is the showcase for all design systems. It built with Angular using SSG, and it uses [Chameleon](https://github.com/genexuslabs/chameleon-controls-library) for the UI components.

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

## Dev server

```bash
npm start
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

After that, you can deploy the `dist/browser` folder if you want the application to be static.
